# The Prototype Project for DDO CD User Interface 
The DDO CD or Dungeons & Dragons Online Character Designer
is a project I plan to write in C++, but I also have other
things in process like Boot.Dev courses and work and family.

Speaking of Boot.dev, this project is my Boot.dev personal
project. Talk about killing two birds with one stone. I get 
to prototype the user interface in Python wxWidgets and complete
a project.

## Running it 
To be able to run the project you either need to have wxPython
installed or set up your venv using the following:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
pip install wxPython
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 ddocdpy.py
```
